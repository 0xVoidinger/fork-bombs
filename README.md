# fork-bombs
The fork bomb is the equivalent of a DDoS attack on your own system. It aims to deprive the system of memory (RAM), leaving nothing for other applications or the operating systemâ€™s vital operations required to keep the systems running, hence crashing it. Just 5 characters long, the fork bomb is not permanently harmful for a computer, just annoying.

This repo contains fork bombs in different languages.
